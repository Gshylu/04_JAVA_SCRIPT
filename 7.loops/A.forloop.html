//if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
//Often this is the case when working with arrays:

//initialize let i = 0 ; // condition i<10 ; //  increment i++ or update to next value
for(let i=0;i<10;i++){
    console.log(i)

} // 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

           <!-- why loops a loop in JavaScript allows a set of statements or instructions
             to be executed repeatedly until a certain condition is fulfilled or true.
              It is used when some task or operation needs to be performed repeatedly
               based on some condition. Loops are also called iteration.-->
