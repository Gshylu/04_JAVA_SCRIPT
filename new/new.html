    <!-- let us begin our basics of Java Script -->
    <script> 
    // java script which is written inside an html document 
    //and we can attach the script as external file 
    //in head section or body section
    document.write("hello world") // it will be shown on display
        console.log("hello world")   // it will be shown in console 


        
    </script>

    <script>

       //Basically we can declare variables in three different ways by using var, let and const keyword
      
       //Variables declared  with var are in the function scope.
       function f1(){
       var a=10;
       }
       console.log(a)	 // we don't get any ouput because it is called outside the function

       //Variables declared  as let are in the block scope.	
       for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
         console.log(i);
       }
       console.log(i);

       //Variables declared  as const are in the block scope.
       {
       const x = 2;
       console.log(x);
       }
       console.log(x);
