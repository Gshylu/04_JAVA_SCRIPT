        <h1>Array In JavaScript</h1>
        <h3>
        1. An array is a collection of values.<br>
        2. It is a list of items, where each item has a particular position in the list<br>
        3. JavaScript array can store a mixed data formats in a single array unlike C, C++ which
         store only a particular data format. This means you can store a string, number, boolean, 
         object, array, etc in a single array<br>
        4.Array makes accessing data really fast from a collection of data. 
            The location of any element in an array is defined by its index value. 
            Index number starts from 0 and goes to the length of the array.
             The complexity of accessing data from an array is O(1).<br>
        5.The array data stored in memory are in a contiguous memory location.
             This means within memory there is a contiguous block of memory that stores the array 
             data. So, when you access any element in an array, 
             you don't need to jump to another memory location to access the data. 
             This is called linear access.<br>
